Foundations : (Rock Paper Scissors)

My first take on JavaScript

Rock Paper Scissor versus a Computer

The Computer will choose between Rock Paper and Scissor.
User will then choose.
Then the winner will be declared.

Best of 5.

Things I learned

how to randomize words in the array
how to fix typo error and still make the code works
how to check if the user inputed right or none.

and lastly

HOW TO FRICKIN MADE A GAME.
So happy!
